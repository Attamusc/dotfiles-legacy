# Contributing

Third-party patches are essential for keeping JSX great. We simply can't
access a number of platforms for running JSX. We want to keep it as easy
as possible to contribute changes that get things working in your environment.

# How to provide a patch

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Edit the source code and add tests to the `t/` directory
3. Test it with `make test-all` (that's what Travis-CI does)
4. Push to your fork
5. Initiate a pull request on GitHub
6. Done

# Note about the license

By contributing code to the JSX project in any form, including sending
a pull request via GitHub, a code fragment or patch via private email or
public discussion groups, you agree to release your code under the terms
of the MIT license that you can find in the LICENSE file included in the JSX
source distribution. You will include the MIT license in the LICENSE file
within each source file that you contribute.
